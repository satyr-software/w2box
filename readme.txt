I too have been using w2box for a long time. The fork is due to the current state of non-maintenance, and with PHP7 (actually 5.3) deprecating some functions (ereg()), which is now broken. This is the first fix I will be committing in shortly.

I have been using w2box for small projects for 2-3 years now. Thought the least I can do as a thank-you-w2box! is release the project back into the wild (including my small fixes & additions), as Clement Beffa has moved away from the project. Enjoy & fork away!
